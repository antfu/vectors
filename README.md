# Vector.js
A immutable arbitrary dimension vector libary for Javascript.

This library provide [`VectorN`](#VectorN) [`Vector3`](#Vector3) [`Vector2`](#Vector2)

## Classes
### VectorN
`VectorN` is arbitrary dimension vector with some basic methods.
```js
const vec4D = new VectorN(4, [0, 2, 3, 4])
```

## Vector3
`Vector3` is 3D vector;
```js
const vec3D = new Vector3(1, 2, 3)
```

## Vector2
```js
const vec2D = new Vector2(2, 3)
```
